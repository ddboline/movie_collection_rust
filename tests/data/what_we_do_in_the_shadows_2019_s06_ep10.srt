1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,450
Welcome to the quarterly report
with yours truly,

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,380
me.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,590
All right.
So investments by sector...

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,590
Things are going
really great at work.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,730
I feel like I finally found what
I'm meant to do in life.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,660
Jimmy.

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,010
- Does anyone ever call you
Big Red?
- No.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,150
And it feels really great
to finally be, you know, appreciated.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,610
Let's go.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,260
- Out.
-  Out.

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,960
- Oh!
- Fuck!

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,720
I finally feel
like I belong somewhere.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,860
Everything is coming up
Guillermo.

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,480
Fuck you too.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,790
Okay.
All my best to Patrice. Bye.

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,970
- Dude, that move you made
on Salazar.
- Mmm.

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,210
Holy shit. How did you know
that we should short that?

18
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,940
You know someone over there?

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,600
Just did my research.
Just leave it at that.

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,080
You know what I say,

21
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,220
you do whatever
you can get away with, right?

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,080
And don't use that.

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,670
That's the kinda shit that
we look for
in our full-time analyst.

24
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,880
Mr. Nelson was saying
he's very pleased

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,160
- with your work.
- What?

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,850
You could be
moving up here real quick, G.

27
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,710
- Oh.
- In fact,

28
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,510
tomorrow night, we should
have a little rager here

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,230
and toast to your badass self.

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,680
Think about preppin' a speech

31
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,100
'cause I got something
special planned for you

32
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,510
that you are gonna love.

33
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,140
Invite some friends, huh?

34
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,860
- Yeah.
- You do have friends, don't ya?

35
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,630
- Yeah. Okay.
I got tons of friends.
- Cool, I wanna meet 'em!

36
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,940
So I'll be making a speech

37
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,080
and you would all
be attending as my friends.

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,430
Well, friends as in your friends
or someone else's?

39
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,120
Someone else's feels better.

40
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,090
Ah, I would be attending
as a valued
Cannon Capital employee,

41
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,850
not your friend.

42
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,920
Okay, you know what? Forget it.
Forget I even asked.

43
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,230
Nonsense. I will also
be attending
as a former employee.

44
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,230
And don't worry,
I will not be "triggered"

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,170
by returning to the corridors
I once kept so very tidy

46
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,100
as chief supreme janitor.

47
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,350
I think you were
just a regular janitor.

48
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,180
And I too shall attend,
for your soiree
shall be the perfect debut

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,530
- for my completed
Cravensworth's Monster.
-  Oh.

50
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,290
It's been a rocky road,
but as you can see,

51
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,980
he's quite the handsome chap.

52
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,940
And far smarter than Nandor.

53
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,330
- What the fuck?
-  Yeah.

54
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,740
I don't know, Laszlo. I mean,

55
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,610
the last time we took him
around other people,

56
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,370
he popped Jerry's head
like a swollen tick.

57
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,710
Jerry did pretty much
deserve that.

58
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,130
And he's promised
not to do it again.

59
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,790
Stand up. Come round here.

60
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,790
If you're going to insist
on bringing him,

61
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,930
he simply must wear trousers.

62
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,100
Not tonight, Josephine.

64
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,770

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,070
All right, it's official.

72
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,690
You are swagged out.

73
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,010
- Will Laszlo like?
- Do you like?

74
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,220
Laszlo master.
What would Laszlo like?

75
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,980
Okay. You know, you and I
don't have to go to this party,
Monster.

76
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,810
I mean, we could stay home
and binge watch a season
of USOT.

77
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,300
United States of Tara.

78
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,200
No. Laszlo say we go party.

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,650
But is that what you want?

80
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,300
Want make Laszlo proud.

81
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,100
Do you want to make me proud?

82
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,380
Laszlo master.

83
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,240
Yeah, all right.

84
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,970
- Hey you, guys.
-  Oh!

85
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,070
Today everyone is talking about
the man of the hour.

86
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,840
Whatever you heard,
don't believe it.
None of it's true.

87
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,080
Come on! We heard the Salazar
short was all you.

88
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,600
Uh... Yeah, that part is true.
You can believe it.

89
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,670
- I believe 'em. I'm a believer.
- Oh, yep!

90
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,670
Oh. Excuse me for a moment.
You made it!

91
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,670
- Look at this! It's the friends!
- Yeah.

92
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,230
- They're real. Pinch me.
- Pinch.

93
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,890
- Sorry.
- Don't mind the cameras here.

95
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,720
We're making a
little promotional documentary

96
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,270
about Cannon Capital in,
what we like to call,
the Cannon way.

97
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,270
- So you'll get used to 'em.
- Jordan.

98
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,000
Ah. Yes, Nan... Nancy?

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,100
- Yeah.
-  Leave it with me.

100
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,420
I say my perfectly normal
friend here
needs to take a piss.

101
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,590
- Ah.
- Where would he do that?

102
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,420
Toilet now.

103
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,120
- Uh, just down the hall
on the left.
- Thanking you. Come on.

104
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,220
Come on. It's to the left.

105
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,090
Maybe I'm trippin' out here,

106
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,330
but isn't that the guy that beat
the fuckin' shit out of you?
Bald guy?

107
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,500
-  What?
I don't think so.
- Looks like him.

108
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,090
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.
- And... Hey, you.

109
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,470
Weren't you a janitor here?

110
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,270
Ha. I get that a lot.
No, that was, um, uh...

111
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,480
my slow-witted brother
who looks a lot like me,

112
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,620
but he's
a completely different guy.

113
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,110
-  Well,
small world, huh?
- Yeah.

114
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,690
But, listen. Sorry we had
to let your brother go.

115
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,760
It just wasn't
a good culture fit, you know?

116
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,460
Sure, sure.

117
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,800
I guess he just
didn't make the grade, so...

118
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,430
I'm glad I'm not that guy.

119
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,120
You tellin' me.
So, what do you do?

120
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,540
I used to command armies
in the Middle East.

121
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,710
- Top secret stuff.
-  Sure. Yes.

122
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,330
Like Mossad?

123
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,400
- Gesundheit.
-  Guillermo, shots!
Come on.

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,850
- Oh, no.
-  You're taking two shots!

125
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,750
- He's taking some shots!
-  Set him up, Jimmy.

126
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,440
Okay. But I'll be right back.
I'll be right back though.

127
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,960
So how do you know Guillermo?

128
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,830
Oh, he used to be
my right-hand man
for many years.

129
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,690
Man, I wish I had
four Guillermos, right?

130
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,800
Really lightened my load
around here.

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,590
I wish I had two Guillermos.

132
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,290
Then you could have one.
I would have one.

133
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,770
And then the two Guillermos
could become friends
or even lovers.

134
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,780
And I could say like,
"Hey, Guillermo,
go fuck yourself."

135
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,740
And then he could do that.

136
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,780
Okay, well...

137
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,750
- Cut that.
- Nice meeting you.

138
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,410
-  There he is.
- Oh, yeah.

139
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,790
No. I cannot wait
to start working with you.

140
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,480
All right. Take care.

141
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,140
No, you take care.

142
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,390
How about we both take care?
Stop it. Okay. Bye.

143
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,420
What?

144
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,290
I have just been offered
an incredible new job.

145
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,400
But is Guillermo gonna be okay
without you watching
over him the whole time?

146
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,360
- Doing what?
- Remember?

147
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,090
The reason you started
working here
in the first place?

148
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,820
Oh, right! I guess
I completely forgot about that.

149
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,270
Oh, well. Fuck it.

150
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,300
He's doing fine, isn't he?

151
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,860
I certainly am.

152
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,970
I must admit, I am sad
to be leaving Cannon Capital.

153
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,730
I never quite figured out
what it is we actually do here.

154
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,970
Lamps?

155
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,420
Making and/or selling
really enormous lamps?

156
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,320
But...
...there's a lot more work

157
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,460
to be done
before I can truly celebrate.

158
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,670
Unfortunately, when you are
quitting your job
in human world,

159
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,780
you have to burn all
of your bridges
at your workplace.

160
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,850
It is a very mysterious
human custom.

161
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,850
I think that they do it
so that their coworkers

162
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,410
that they leave behind
will not miss them so much.

163
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,820
It's sort of sweet.

164
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,450
I do not fully understand
this tradition,

165
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,760
but as they say
in ancient Callipraxos...

166
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,180
Which means
"fuck up as much shit
as possible."

167
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,600
Yeah, they were
a really destructive society.

168
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,260
What's he saying?

169
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,500
- It's Latin, you pricks.
-  I knew that.

170
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,090
Hey,
why don't we take a break

171
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,370
and see how many pizza rolls
we can get in your mouth?

172
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,200
Laszlo happy?

173
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,270
No.
Recite pi to the fiftieth point.

174
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,890
3.1416?

175
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,000
Five! Five!

176
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,900
What are you doing?
He's not having any fun.

177
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,590
Of course he is.
He's having a great time.

178
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,940
He's the life of the party.

179
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,800
No, he's not.

180
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,250
And I don't appreciate you
trotting him out
like some dancing bear.

181
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,630
Well, I don't give a monkey's
what you appreciate.

182
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,260
He's as happy as a horse.

183
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,570
I suggest you go
and get yourself a cocktail.

184
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,740
You get yourself a cocktail.

185
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,500
-  Seven.
-  Did he get it?

186
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,890
-  Yes.
- Of course he did.

187
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,850
He's the best, that's why.
Come out here.

188
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,230
Gather around, everyone.
I want you to watch this.

189
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,370
That's it. Out you come.
Fast as you can.

190
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,960
Turn the music on.

191
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,030
He likes this one.

192
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,520
I mean, he's no Patrick Swayze,
but he can dance.

193
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,110
Pretty good, right? That's it.

194
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,520
I stop now?

195
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,490
No, no. You stop
when I damn well tell you.

196
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,320
He never gets tired.
He can do that all night.

197
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,430
Oh, Cathy.
I've been meaning to tell you,

198
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,570
your spreadsheets
are absolute hogshit, girlie.

199
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,640
It's, like, are you numerically
demented or something?

200
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,470
And Brock,

201
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,090
your fiancée
has been cheating on you
with your brother for ages.

202
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm gonna miss you both so much.

203
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,930
Shit.

204
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,130
Oh, hi. Have you seen Jordan?

205
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,860
Someone broke the glass
in conference room B.

206
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,520
- Lisa, my favorite.
- Oh, come on.

207
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,000
- Your voice
is incredibly deep...
- Yes.

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,870
...and nasal and grating.

209
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,630
And your whole vibe,

210
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,600
it's like you crave love
'cause you never had it
as a child,

211
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,870
like, where were your parents?

212
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,460
You're really hard
to be around.

213
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,430
I said I wouldn't cry!

214
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,540
That's not your desk.

215
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,230
Not anymore. It's not.

216
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,540
Very cool.

217
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,610
A water closet in your office?

218
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,470
- Oh, yeah.
- You ever get
tempted to, you know,

219
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,440
just sit at your desk

220
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,100
and whip it out and see
if you can piss
right into the toilet?

221
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,930
No, but I'll have
to give that a try.

222
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,900
We don't need to be talking
about piss in front of my boss.

223
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,410
Ease up, G.

224
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,210
I'm always telling Guillermo
that he works too hard.

225
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,250
He's always here.
I gotta watch out for this guy.

226
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,560
Otherwise, one day,
it'll be him behind this desk,

227
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,080
- right?
- No. No.

228
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,050
My mini me. My mentee.
My right-hand man.

229
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,980
He used to do
a similar thing for me.

230
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,670
- We called it shit work.
-  Ah.

231
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,640
- Same, same.
- No, not the same.

232
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,570
For one, I actually
get something from working here.

233
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,960
Well...
...why don't we
take a little breath here?

234
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,230
- Yeah.
- How about you go get me a beer?

235
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,580
- Get yourself some too.
- Got it, boss.

236
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,790
And one for me.

237
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,240
Really? You want a beer too?

238
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,590
Yes, Guillermo.
I would like a beer

239
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,070
on the rocks.

240
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,250
-  Just go get the beers.
- Yeah.

241
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,520
It's always a fucking discussion
with this guy.

242
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,010
It was the same
when he worked for me,
you know? So argumentative.

243
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,490
- Mm-hmm.
- Always talking back

244
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,630
like some kind of needy child.

245
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,190
Exactly. Just, like,
do what I fucking say.

246
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,780
Yes, like a servant.

247
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,640
Those were your words,
not mine.

248
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,090
Sure. Sure.

249
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,790
But you do value Guillermo
as a part of the team, right?

250
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,000
Let me tell you something.
You gotta have at least one guy

251
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,340
who would do anything
to make you happy.

252
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,410
Neediness is a great motivator.

253
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,110
He was always
needing something.

254
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,070
- Food. Water.
- Yeah.

255
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,660
A new brush for my hair.

256
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,110
Classic beta shit, right?

257
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,050
So, how do you deal
with the beta shits?

258
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,840
Well,
probably the same way you do.

259
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,880
Smile,
and a little speck of hope,

260
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,980
and they will do anything
you need them to do.

261
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,230
I mean anything.

262
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,200
But, I mean, you wouldn't
take advantage
of Guillermo like that, right?

263
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,990
No. Officially, no.

264
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,690
I have grown suspicious
of Guillermo's beloved Jordan.

265
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,240
I'm not sure that he has
Guillermo's best interests
at heart.

266
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,070
But surely, a true leader would
never dream

267
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,630
of treating a loyal underling
with such contempt.

268
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,910
That's point.

269
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,080
It's simply not done.

270
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,910
Would you excuse me
for a moment, Jordan? I just...

271
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,950
I gotta make sure that Guillermo
isn't putting too many rocks
in my beer.

272
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,230
No, seriously, man, I feel like
everyone's having kids now.

273
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,720
It's, like, gross.

274
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,060
Sorry, I don't wanna hang out
with babies all the time.

275
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,130
Yeah. What about you, man?
You want kids?

276
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,040
Uh... kids? What am I made of?
Money?

277
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,760
- Give me that. That's my man.
- Nice.

278
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,140
- That's what I'm talking about.
-  Fight! Danger!

279
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,770
-  Oh!
- Sorry!

280
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,490
No sweat, man.

281
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,120
We're just gonna go
get this cleaned up,
like, away from here.

282
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,460
What the fuck happened there?

283
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,120
You were doing well
with the wankers.

284
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,300
- Mistake.
- I should damn well say so.

285
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,060
Chill your tits, Laszlo.

286
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,750
You chill your tits.
My monster, my rules.

287
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,920
But he has feelings.

288
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,750
Feelings? He's a monster.

289
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,030
He'll have feelings when I tell
him to have feelings.

290
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,580
Toilet.

291
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,410
-  What a surprise.
- Now, see what you've done?

292
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,490
"I feel like I finally found
a place where I belong.

293
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,590
And I wanna
specially thank Jordan

294
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,730
for seeing something in me
that perhaps I didn't see"--

295
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,350
Guillermo,
I must speak with you urgently.

296
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,150
No, not right now.
I'm practicing my speech.

297
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,740
Guillermo, I do not trust
this man Jordan
nor his intentions for you.

298
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,600
Of course.

299
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,400
- Of course what?
- Things are finally
looking up for me.

300
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,300
I have a purpose, a future.

301
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,440
And here you are,
trying to ruin it all,
'cause why?

302
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
- 'Cause you're jealous?
- I'm trying to help you.

303
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,090
You've never believed in me,
never encouraged me.

304
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,370
You just let me sit and stew

305
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,580
and wonder endlessly
why I wasn't good enough.

306
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,380
That does not sound
like something I would do.

307
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,000
And Jordan is not like you.

308
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,690
I'm about to get promoted
to full-time analyst,

309
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,070
and here you are trying
to tear it all down
like you always do

310
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,590
when I have something special
in front of me.

311
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,490
All right, everybody, circle up.
Come on, bring it in.

312
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,980
Now, you know how much
I hate public speaking,
but you guys...

313
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,320
- Guillermo--
- No.

314
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,810
This is how it's supposed to be.

315
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,810
You work hard
and you get rewarded.

316
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,190
And if you don't like that,
you don't have to be
a part of my life.

317
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,330
We just made a sizable chunk
of change shorting Salazar.

318
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,950
- Let's hear it. Yeah!
-  Yeah!

319
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,060
But there is one person
that I really gotta shout out.

320
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,410
He's the reason
why we're all here tonight.

321
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,620
Cannon's visionary founder,
Mr. Gene Nelson!

322
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,860
A legend in our midst! Yeah.

323
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,240
Don't let me interrupt you,
Jordan.

324
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,870
Tonight's about you
and your stellar team.

325
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,420
Well, you know what, sir?
It is a team.

326
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,630
I'm always saying
to the people here

327
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,560
that we are like the Avengers
of Wall Street, right?

328
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,500
We got the, of course,
Captain America back there.

329
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,020
And Black Widow
with Spider-man right there.

330
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,780
And Raj, you know you
are my Thor, baby,
dropping that hammer.

331
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,200
And who else?

332
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,720
I guess Groot.
So solid. And... Huh!

333
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,930
Well, what does that make me?
Who brings everybody together?

334
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,890
- Tony Stark.
- Tony Stark. I'll take it.

335
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,690
Let's raise a glass
to Mr. Nelson.

336
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,520
Let's keep this rager raging.

337
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,590
- Hey, Jordan.
I thought you were...
- Thanks, buddy.

338
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,250
-  What about my...
- Hey, Mr. Nelson. VIP area...

339
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,420
Thank you so much for that,
Jordan.

340
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,250
But I will make
a real announcement.

341
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,880
Sadly, my time here
at Cannon Capital Strategies

342
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,220
is coming to an end.

343
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,880
I know.
Let your tears out, it's okay.

344
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,200
But I got an offer
I couldn't refuse

345
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
from a very exciting
new company,

346
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,370
and I think
they really wanted me

347
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,300
because all I had to do
to get the job

348
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,650
was send them
ten thousand dollars in cash

349
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,450
along with some photographs
of my feet.

350
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,970
Wait, what?

351
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,830
- Headhunted!
-  Yeah!

352
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,630
So, now all I need to do
is convince 15 more people
to join me.

353
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,560
- Who's in?
- Uh, you just got scammed.

354
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,430
Yeah, enjoy your totally real,
new job, bitch.

355
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,080
- What?
- And if they're not hiring,

356
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,770
- I'm sure the Ren Faire is.
Great outfit.
- Oh, yeah.

357
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,190
- I've got a new job--
- Leave Nadja alone!

358
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,710
Relax.
Oh, I don't want another head.

359
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,680
- I swear to fuck.
-  Calm down.

360
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,710
Dick.

361
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,160
Thanks a lot, asshole.

362
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,750
You behave like an animal.

363
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,380
Come on.
Stop beating yourself up.

364
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,310
Laszlo mad at me.

365
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,970
No, he's not mad at you.

366
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,900
You were just exhibiting
classic party behavior.

367
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,690
Who cares
if you get loose as a goose?

368
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,320
I monster.

369
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,250
You are not a monster.

370
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,910
You are a cool dude.

371
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,260
Shit. Your staple's leaking.

372
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,190
All right. I'm gonna call you
next week.
Thanks for coming by.

373
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,540
Hey, Jordan. Can I talk to you?

374
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,540
Sorry. Old man Nelson
was going on and on,

375
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,780
but his nurse/wife
got him out of here,

376
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,230
- so, what's up?
- Uh...

377
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,750
I was just wondering why
you didn't let me go up there

378
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,340
and give my speech?

379
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,550
I'm so-- I'm sorry.
It slipped my mind.

380
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,420
With Mr. Nelson being here,
it was crazy.

381
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,730
I just didn't want things to get
too confusing for everybody.

382
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,900
It's just that you asked me
to prepare a speech

383
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,110
and I thought you were happy
with the work
that I've been doing.

384
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,980
I am happy. I'm thrilled.

385
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,700
In fact, I got you something

386
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,430
that's way better than a stupid
shout-out and a speech.

387
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,810
Something that you've earned.

388
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,090
Wait right here.

389
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,640
It's happening.

390
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,090
Close your eyes.

391
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,920
Here we go. Ta-da! Open 'em up.

392
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,620
Just a little thank you for all
the hard work
that you do around here.

393
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,960
We make a hell of a team,
don't we?

394
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,590
Wow. Thank you.

395
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,550
- Hmm.
- Um...

396
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,940
Just put it right there
on your desk. It'll look nice.

397
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,560
It's just a...

398
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,980
I just thought that maybe
you were going
to give me a promotion?

399
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,190
No, no, I... I can't promote you
until you're ready.

400
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,810
It'll happen
when the time is right.

401
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,400
How much time would that be,
just, hypothetically?

402
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,030
Oh, I don't know.
Ballpark a couple of years.

403
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,620
You can't rush paying your dues,
Guillermo.

404
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,000
No.

405
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,170
No.

406
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,380
- No!
- Whoa!

407
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,520
When the time is right?
I already wasted so much time!

408
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,590
What's your fucking damage, bro?

409
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,940
My damage is, I'm tired
of being strung along
and I'm not doing it anymore!

410
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,320
Really?

411
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,290
Well, maybe you should
check your attitude and remember

412
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,460
that you're talking
to your fucking boss.

413
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,400
You're the person that helps
actually important people

414
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,160
get their shit done.

415
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,610
You're not a killer.
You gotta know
your fucking place.

416
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,030
Excuse me?

417
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,060
Dude, that's company property.

418
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,310
- You know
who you're fucking with?
- I'm sorry.

419
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,240
I don'’t think you know
who you'’re fucking with.

420
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,790
- Oh, no, no. Nandor.
- No.

421
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,520
Nandor, put him down.
Nandor, no.

422
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,800
You're maybe more successful
and rich and smart
and better looking

423
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,180
and have a generally
cooler vibe than him.

424
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,630
But you do not get
to speak to him like that.

425
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,700
- Okay, just-just
put him down please.
-  Put me down.

426
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,880
I cannot have you speaking
to Guillermo this way.

427
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,050
Drop him! Now.

428
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,500
Fine.

429
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,130
You know what? You're right.

430
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,170
I'm not a killer. But I know
a way to hurt you even worse.

431
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,720
I think I'll give a call
to the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

432
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,070
Yes!

433
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,420
- What is that?
- Don't worry about it.

434
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,250
Bullshit. What?
You're gonna come at me?

435
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,110
You openly talk about
insider trading constantly.

436
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,940
Oh, yeah? Well,
how are you gonna prove it?

437
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,910
Yeah, bro, it's my documentary.

438
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,640
It's his documentary.

439
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,090
Yeah. Over the years,
I've learned
that you gotta protect yourself.

440
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,440
Hey, take a look at this.

441
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,920
And information
is a great way of doing that.

442
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,340
- All right, you got all that?
- Yes.

443
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,440
Now delete it.

444
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,170
- Why?
- Dude, no paper trail.

445
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,960
It's cool.
The SEC guy is a total pussy.
He's not gonna do shit.

446
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,480
People love telling me things.

447
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,110
Maybe it's my face
or that they don't know
I'm in the room.

448
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,490
Either way, I keep receipts.

449
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,080
And I'm not talking
just about the CVS ones.

450
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,940
It's his documentary.

451
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,360
Cut. Cut. Cut!

452
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,880
Well, that was a bust.

453
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,400
It looks like I'm back
to the drawing board

454
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,230
with Cravensworth's Monster.

455
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,820
- I'm not Cravensworth's Monster.
-  What are you then?

456
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,140
- Robinson's Monster.
- Huh.

457
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,550
Don't be so preposterous.

458
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,170
Well, you were really hard
on the poor guy in there.

459
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,000
And what was he doing?
He was just cutting it up
with the guys.

460
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,800
He cried in the bathroom.

461
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,800
He even had Nadja's back
without popping that guy's head.

462
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,600
Face it, we created
a monster with real emotions.

463
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,640
I, for one, am jazzed.

464
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,020
- Jazz.
-  Yeah.

465
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,190
I suppose you have a point.
And between us, Colin Robinson,

466
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,750
we will force the entire
scientific community
to eat shit.

467
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,850
- Well, we've gotta.
- Yeah.

468
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,370
I love both my fathers.

469
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,930
- Of course you do.
- Sure you do.

470
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,960
Now kiss.

471
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,760
I'm, uh...

472
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,170
- What-What was that?
- Kiss, Daddies, now.

473
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,860
No, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

474
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,760
I don't know. I mean, we could.

475
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,420
We still have 7 floors to go.

476
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,110
He really takes
after his daddy.

477
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,180
Horny little freak.

478
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,840
All right.
Let's get out of this shithole.

479
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,980
-  Yes.
-  Absolutely.

480
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,220
Fair enough.

481
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,670
Well, usually,
it's kind of a one-person thing.

482
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,260
Give me your hand. Careful.

483
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,370
After you.

484
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,820
Wow. What a night!

485
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,200
Yeah. I feel like
it could've gone better for me.

486
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,820
The way the two of us
just took down
that evil guy like that.

487
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,240
This must be what it feels like
to do a good deed.

488
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,140
I feel so... so... charged up!

489
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,380
Fuck these guys!

490
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,590
Oh, shit!

491
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,980
Yeah! [laughs] Suck it.

492
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,120
- Go, Nandor!
-  This feels incredible.

493
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,670
You know, it also make me wonder

494
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,330
what else
we could accomplish together.

495
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,260
I'm not going back
to being your familiar.

496
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,810
I'm not talking about you
being my familiar, Guillermo.

497
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,850
Look, I will always
be killing people
because I'm a vampire.

498
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,750
It's what we do.
But what if I was more picky?

499
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,440
If I use my powers for good.

500
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,790
- To bring justice
to this unjust world.
- Oh.

501
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,000
You mean like Batman.

502
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,930
I don't know who that is.

503
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,350
But also, I was thinking,
why not create
a secret underground lair.

504
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:02,050
And, I would have
my very own young sidekick.

505
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,670
Like Robin.

506
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,430
I don't think robbing people
is a good idea.

507
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,500
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

508
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,920
You do know! This is why
we've been brought together.

509
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,200
It's not for me to make you
a fucking vampire.

510
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,510
Fuck all that shit.

511
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,340
But for us to create
an unbreakable alliance.

512
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,270
To help people
in this broken society.

513
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,690
Some shit like that.

514
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,310
Face it, Guillermo.
You're never gonna be
just a normal human guy.

515
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,140
You don't belong with them.

516
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,560
You belong with us.

517
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,180
But I'm not a vampire.

518
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,570
No, you're not.
You're something even cooler.

519
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,570
You are a warrior.

520
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,510
Okay. Let go of my hand now.

521
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,720
- It's a bit clammy.
- Sorry.

522
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,130
What else can I throw
at that building?

523
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,000
♪ Violent flares
And bullets loading ♪

524
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,140

526
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,630
I'm done with that pinstripe
pit of corporate despair.

527
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,770
- You were only there
for an hour, Laszlo.
- That was enough.

528
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,120
I had a great time.
Got myself a souvenir.

529
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,260
So did I.

530
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,360
Oh, no. Is that Lisa?

531
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,950
She really was my favorite.

532
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,570
Well, good night.

533
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,330
I'll be in the shed
if you guys--

534
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,370
Guillermo? Where are you going?

535
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,920
Get back here.

536
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,890
We've got things to discuss.

537
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,720
First on the agenda,
let's talk capes.

538
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,480
What if we wear them
on our fronts?

539
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,520

It feels like coagulatin'♪
